The Book Management System is built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs, and MongoDB. It provides an admin interface to manage book-related activities efficiently. 
Admins can issue books to users and process returns, with the system automatically calculating rental fees based on the duration between the issue and return dates. 
The system is designed to streamline the tracking of book availability, issue and return records, and user activity, ensuring efficient management of a library or book rental service.
